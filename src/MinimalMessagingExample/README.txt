This package contains a client-server chat application,
written in as few lines of code as possible. There's not
much error handling, but multiple clients can connect to
the server and send simple text to each other.

The basic structure of the application (Sockets and Threads)
would work for any sort of messaging. Instead of sending text,
you could use Serialization, or XML, or whatever you want.
